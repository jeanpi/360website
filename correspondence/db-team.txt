Database corresponence:
* Database names, table names, and  column names should not contain spaces. People use camelCasing or under_bars generally to separate words.

* What is the database name?

* The courses table should have a 'Schedule Line Number' or 'Section' column, for when there is more than one time slot offering for a particular course

* The enrollment table should have 'year' and 'quarter' columns

* The 'question information' table seems like it should be 'peer_ratings' and it should include a 'rating' column and a 'comment' column (the '/answer' part of the 'questions' table can be removed.

* The questions table should only hold information about questions and should contain a 'rating_scale' column 

* There should be a table for keeping track of teams' and groups' members and the team/group names. e.g.
| team_or_group_name | user_id |
| iOSByte                       | 123456 |
| Overbyte                     | 123456 |

* The ratings questions table can be combined with the question information table (the uniqueness of   rows in the 'question information'--or peer_ratings--table can be determined by the question_id, giver_id, and receiver_id)
