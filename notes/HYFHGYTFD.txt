The first thing I would do is check what type of procedure that they may be using, and based on the procedure I would then check how they decided to build the teams and divide the work. I would also check to see if each group was assigned the similar amount of work and if they set deadlines/expectation dates of when that particular portion of their work will be done.

I would look for rough draft and final versions of the teams work from the very beginning throughout the end. By doing so, I will be able to see which team has done more work and put in more effort. By measuring the amount of effort, I will be able to get a good idea of the quality. (Example, if one team had one rough draft and then their final, that shows that they only changed it once. If there was a team with multiple drafts, that will show that they did a good job of analyzing and have a better understanding of what was missing and was/is necessary).

 I would go over each teams work individually and see if what they are doing is meeting that proportion of the full projects requirements. If it was'n't, I would then ask them if they have been communicating with the other teams in order to get the feedback/information they need in order to reach those requirements.
