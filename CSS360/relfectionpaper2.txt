After going over and studying all of the different processes in class, the two that appeal to me are RAD and Spiral. I really like the RAD mainly because there are 3 teams that go through the same stages/steps. This is great because if one team finishes something before another, they can help the other team(s) who is behind. Not only does this process make it easier for all teams to stay on track, but it is a good way for the team to improve on their communication skills. What appeals to me the most about Spiral is it's cycles. It's cycles allow you to go back and make the changes that are necessary, unlike many other processes. With the Spiral having certain steps/stages repeated, it allows those who use this process to create and provide something of higher quality.
